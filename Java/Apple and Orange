/*
Given a start point named s, an endpoint named t, an apple tree at position a,
an orange tree at position b, an array of where apples fell named apples, 
and an array of where oranges fell named oranges, this challenge is to print
how many apples and oranges landed on a house roof, defined as the space between
the start and end points s and t. The positions of each point and the fallen
fruit are indicated by integers.

An example of the layout:
a  s t  b
